## Build VON-Network
If all of the previous steps have been completed, it is now possible to initialize a Von-Network.

Git Repository: https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

Use below command to download code to your local:
```python
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.git
```
Go to the directory below
```python
cd von-network/
```
Use below command to build nodes of the network:
```python
sudo ./manage build
```
Use below command to start nodes of the network:
```python
sudo ./manage start
```
All VON-Network nodes should now be active.

## Run Agents 

* **Agents requirements**: 
  * Von-network running
  
### Install Agents
Reference: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/README.md#running-in-docker

Git Repository: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python

Use below command to download code to your local machine:
```python
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
```
Go to the directory
```python
cd aries-cloudagent-python/demo
```
Now it's possible to initialize the agents. To run the Issuer Agent type:
```python
./run_demo faber
```
Issuer Agent is running on port 8021.
In a new terminal, change directory into aries-cloudagent-python directory of your clone of this repository. Start the Holder Agent by issuing the following command:
```python
./run_demo alice
```
Holder Agent is running on port 8031.
Now perform the same for the Verifier Agent:
```python
./run_demo acme
```
Verifier Agent is running on port 8041.

## Run Identity
* **Identity requirements**: 
  * Von-network running
  * Agents running
  * Mongo active

Before running this project, you must create an .env file, based on the .env.template available in identity/src. Further detailing can be found in said file.

To run the Identity Controllers, go to identity/src folder, then type in the command line:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
To stop the project, simply type:
```
